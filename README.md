# GameOMatic

GameOMatic has requested that Individual Software Engineering students create some utilities for them that will speed production of their games.

   1. **Test the random number generator.** <br>
   Before using the random library in python, GameOMatic wants to make sure it is uniform.  In order to play their version of Dungeons and Dragons they need dodecahedron (12 sided dice) simulated in a function.  They want to test it by rolling it 10,000 times and determine whether the distribution of numbers is uniform.  Use the random library and a list to do this among other python entities.

   2. **Build a Dictionary that provides the inventory for a number of characters in the game.**<br>
   It should have the ability to increment or decrement the tally for each characters inventory items.  Represent this list and then show that:
      1. You can increment and decrement counts of each of the items
      2. You can add to and delete from items in a character's inventory
      3. You can add characters and inventory to those characters.

    Gandolf:  5 food, 10 grapefruit, 7 green potions, 8 red potions, 10 spells of enchantment

    Frodo: 0 food, 5 kiwi, 7 wands of confusion, 8 green potions

    Sauron: 5 bat wings, 10 evil spells, 5 fire wands

## Create a function to add Bilbo with an inventory like Frodo's. 

## Indicate when an inventory item is at zero.
