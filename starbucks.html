    <p>
      <strong>Starbucks Corporation</strong> is an American multinational chain
      of coffeehouses and roastery reserves headquartered in Seattle,
      Washington. As the world's largest coffeehouse chain, Starbucks is seen to
      be the main representation of the United States' second wave of coffee
      culture.[6][7] As of early 2020, the company operates over 30,000
      locations worldwide in more than 70 countries. Starbucks locations serve
      hot and cold drinks, whole-bean coffee, microground instant coffee known
      as VIA, espresso, caffe latte, full- and loose-leaf teas including Teavana
      tea products, Evolution Fresh juices, Frappuccino beverages, La Boulange
      pastries, and snacks including items such as chips and crackers; some
      offerings (including their annual fall launch of the Pumpkin Spice Latte)
      are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store.
