# Object-oriented Prog Assignment: Scrooge McDuck's Bank

You have been hired by Scrooge McDuck to handle the banking accounts of his nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck.

Each of the Bank accounts contains:

    1. their duck bank account number which is 6 digits

    2. their balance

    3. their name
   
    4. The maximum amount they can withdraw each time which is equal to 10% of their account:

    5. what is the total amount of withdrawals

    6. what is the total amount of deposits

    7. what is the total amount of penalties

**Each time one of the nephews withdraws from their account, the other two nephews get the same amount deposited in their account by Scrooge McDuck from Scrooge McDuck's account.**

**If a nephew asks to withdraw too much they get penalized $5 and no money is sent to the other accounts. Since Scrooge owns the bank he gets the penalty fees added to his account.**

### Here are their beginning balances and their account number:

    Huey Duck       $150        700007
    Dewey Duck      $350        800008
